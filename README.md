# MarketWatch Insights Dashboard

A Streamlit application that surfaces real-time stock price trends, financial news, and AI-powered sentiment analytics for marquee tickers such as **AAPL**, **TSLA**, and **MSFT**. The dashboard brings together Yahoo Finance pricing data and NewsAPI headlines, and enriches the headlines with NLP-driven sentiment scores to help users uncover the relationship between market news and price moves.

## Features
- ðŸ“ˆ **Interactive stock charts** powered by Plotly for zoomable historical exploration.
- ðŸ“° **Live financial headlines** sourced from NewsAPI and tagged with sentiment labels (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
- ðŸ¤– **AI sentiment engines**: choose between fast TextBlob analysis or advanced Hugging Face transformer models.
- ðŸ”— **Correlation insights** overlaying sentiment and price, plus autogenerated narrative takeaways.
- ðŸ“¥ **CSV export or email sharing** of the combined daily stock and sentiment summary.
- ðŸ”® **Predictive signal** using a lightweight scikit-learn regression model to estimate next-day movement.

## Project Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Streamlit front-end and layout
â”œâ”€â”€ data_fetcher.py        # Yahoo Finance & NewsAPI integration
â”œâ”€â”€ sentiment_analyzer.py  # Sentiment analysis helpers (TextBlob / Transformers)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # Documentation and deployment instructions
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install dependencies
```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd MarketWatch-Insights-Dashboard
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API secrets
Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file (or set environment variables) containing your NewsAPI key and (optionally) SMTP credentials for email alerts:
```toml
newsapi_key = "YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"

# Optional email settings for the in-app alert feature
smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
smtp_port = 587
email_username = "you@example.com"
email_password = "YOUR_APP_PASSWORD"
email_sender = "MarketWatch Dashboard <you@example.com>"
```
Alternatively, export the key (and email values) as environment variables before running the app:
```bash
export NEWSAPI_KEY="YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"
export SMTP_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
export SMTP_PORT="587"
export EMAIL_USERNAME="you@example.com"
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="YOUR_APP_PASSWORD"
export EMAIL_SENDER="MarketWatch Dashboard <you@example.com>"
```

### 3. Run the Streamlit app locally
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This launches the dashboard at `http://localhost:8501`. Use the sidebar to toggle sentiment engines, enable CSV export, and explore insights.

## Deployment to Streamlit Cloud
1. Push this repository to GitHub (or another supported Git provider).
2. Log in to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and create a new app pointing to your repository.
3. Set `app.py` as the entrypoint.
4. In the Streamlit Cloud dashboard, open **App settings â†’ Secrets** and add:
   ```toml
   newsapi_key = "YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"
   ```
5. Deploy. Streamlit Cloud will install dependencies from `requirements.txt` automatically.

## Usage Tips
- **Refresh data**: Use the refresh button to clear cached results and fetch the latest quotes and headlines.
- **Advanced sentiment**: Selecting the Hugging Face option loads a transformer model the first time you use itâ€”expect a short delay.
- **Interpretation guidance**: Review the insight banner and footer notes within the app to understand how sentiment correlates with market moves.
- **Email alerts**: Provide a recipient address in the sidebar to send the latest insights (optionally with CSV attachment) once SMTP credentials are configured.
- **Predictive modeling**: Expand the date range to give the regression model more training data and generate a clearer next-day signal.
